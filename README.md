Conclusion:
* Program without documentation.
* index.html is used from the build (Bad Practice.)
* Double package manager like yarn and npm. i find many dependency errors. Deprecated, outdated & more.
* Words inciting to kill are found within the code.
* This program was developed with the intention that the developer and God only know how it works.
* Inside package.json there is a duplicate object key.
* runs on port 8080 not on port 3000.
* Remove Malware
